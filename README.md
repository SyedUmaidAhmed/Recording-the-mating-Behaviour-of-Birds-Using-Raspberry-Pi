# Recording-the-mating-Behaviour-of-Birds-Using-Raspberry-Pi
This is screenshot(code) taken from the book based on the research of mating behaviour of animals. It was puely written by Uncle Claude.

The biggest advantage of this code is that it has already sync the folder (where videos are saved) directly to the google drive. Also it removes the file after syncing. Making space free in  the Raspberry Pi memory.
